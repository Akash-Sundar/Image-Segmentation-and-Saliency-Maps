# Panoptic Segmentation using SOLO

<!-- Panoptic segmentation is a scene understanding problem that combines the prediction from both instance and semantic segmentation into a general unified output.
This project implements a location-based panoptic segmentation model, modifying the state-of-the-art EfficientPS architecture by using SOLOv2 as the instance segmentation head instead of a Mask-RCNN. -->

## Novelty

We replace the Mask-RCNN architecture from the instance head with a SOLOv2 architecture in order to improve the instance segmentation of the EfficientPS model.\
The Mask-RCNN losses now will be replaced by SOLOv2â€™s Focal Loss for semantic category classification and DiceLoss for mask prediction.\
This approach of using a location-based instance segmentation for panoptic segmentation will improve upon the performance metrics.

Early research explored various techniques for Instance segmentation and Semantic segmentation separately. Initial panoptic segmentation methods heuristically combine predictions from state-of-the-art instance segmentation network and semantic segmentation network in a post-processing step. However, they suffered from large computational overhead, redundancy in learning and discrepancy between the predictions of each network.\
Recent works implemented top-down manner with shared components or in a bottom-up manner sequentially. This again did not utilize component sharing and suffered from low computational efficiency, slow runtimes and subpar results.\
EfficientPS:
- Shared backbone: EfficientNet
- Feature aligning semantic head, modified Mask R-CNN
- Panoptic fusion module: dynamic fusion of logits based on mask confidences
- Jointly optimized end-to-end, Depth-wise separable conv, Leaky ReLU
- 2 way FPN : semantically rich multiscale features -->
